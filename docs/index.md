# Overview

Elemental is a software stack enabling a centralized, full cloud-native OS management with Kubernetes.

Cluster Node OSes are built and maintained via container images through the [{elemental_toolkit_name}] and installed on new hosts using the [{elemental_cli_name}].

The [{elemental_operator_name}] and the [{ranchersystemagent_name}] enable Rancher Manager to fully control Elemental clusters, from the installation and management of the OS on the Nodes to the provisioning of new K3s or RKE2 clusters in a centralized way.

Ready to give it a try? Get an Elemental Cluster up and running following the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) section.
